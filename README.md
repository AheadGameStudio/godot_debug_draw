Debug drawing utility
==========================

This is a small debug drawing script, which you can setup as an auto-load singleton. It lets you print text on the screen, draw boxes or lines from anywhere in your code. It is mostly geared towards 3D at the moment.

The name "DDD" comes from my own use as an instrumented debugging tool, because once I'm done I have to remove all calls to it. With a name like that, you can be certain to find it quickly.


Usage
-------

Once installed under `addons/zylann.ddd`, add the `ddd.gd` script as an auto-load to your project and start using it as a singleton.
